    title: "Is your or your partners snoring keeping you awake? They could have Sleep Apnoea?",
    contents: [
      "So what actually is snoring?",
      "Snoring occurs when airway passages are narrowed or obstructed causing inhaled air pressure to vibrate the soft palate.",
      "The airways or air passages run from your nose to your chest.",
      "In order to treat the snoring the cause needs to be identified.",
      "Possible causes could be:",
      "A blocked nose due to a cold or an allergy. This would be a temporary case of snoring, worsened if you need to open your mouth to breath as this would accentuate the vibration of the soft paplate.",
      "Extra weight and or soft tissue around your neck (can be caused by gaining weight or aging).", 
      "A very small jaw structure.",
      "The various causes mentioned above can all cause a drop in blood oxygen levels, due to the obstructed airways. The drop in blood oxygen levels results in needing to wake up in order to be able to breathe again. This results in a disrupted sleep of frequent waking through the night. The pattern repeats each time you fall back to sleep. Which also causes surges in blood pressure and in turn can put stress on the heart. All of this can result in not getting enough healthy deep sleep, disrupted hormone cycles, brain fog, poorer mental health and feeling fatigued constantly during the day etc.",
      "Luckily normal snoring is not considered to raise your risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke or high blood pressure.",
      "However, in sleep apnoea’s case breathing becomes disrupted. In some types of sleep apnoea the airway can become completely blocked off and result in a cessation of breathing altogether.",
      "Where as regular snoring generally occurs without the cessation of breathing.",
      "Sleep Apnoea should be taken care of as soon as possible due to the serious health risks associated with it.",
      "Sleep Apnoea is often broken down into three types:",
      "1)  Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA): involves a physical or anatomical blockage or narrowing of the airways.",
      "2)  Central sleep apnea: is a result of a communication issue between the brain and the airway muscles and doesn’t involve an obstructed airway.",
      "3)  Complex sleep apnea: in brief is a combination of obstructive sleep apnoea and central sleep apnea. It is fairly involved and more information about it can be found in the links listed below.",
      "Obstructive Sleep Apnoea is the most common of the three types and is further classified based on its severity.",
      "Its usually classified into mild, moderate or severe types. Severe OSA is considered the more harmful type as it repeatedly stops the breathing process during sleep. Where as in mild OSA sleep isn’t as disrupted. However, this can make it harder initially to identify as a cause of the sleeping disorders associated symptoms.",
      "Some general indicators of Sleep Apnoea can be:",
      "- Chronic snoring",
      "- Disrupted sleep often with frequent sudden waking",
      "- Constantly feeling tired on waking or fatigued throughout the day",
      "- Others noticing you pausing in breathing while asleep",
      "Some immediate remedies that could be trialed for mild OSA include:",
      "Changing your sleeping posture. For example switching to side lying instead of lying on your back.",
      "Reducing alcohol consumption. As it can impair the brains functionality including its instructions to the muscles that control breathing.",
      "If overweight losing some weight to ease any additional pressure around the neck and on the airways.",
      "If these changes don’t help you may need to see us to discuss other options such as:",
      "Using a mouth guard. These can range from store bought to actually seeing a specialist to get one especially fitted for your jaw",
      "CPAP (Continuous Positive Airways Pressure). It is a device that works like a reverse vacuum cleaner. Instead of sucking air up, it blows air into the airways to keep the airways propped open. However, it is a treatment that may not suit a lot of people as it involves wearing a mask every night when you sleep.",
      "Surgical procedures. These may be particularly considered if you’re a young person with the problem and it’s due to a structural issue like having a small jaw.",
      "As you can see snoring and sleep apnoea can be quite complex and have many causes. So the treatment options vary widely as well. There are more treatment options available than those mentioned above.",
      "You and your loved ones deserve a decent unbroken nights sleep!",
      "So please if either you or your loved one are a snorer, and you’re concerned about the impact it’s having on your health, make an appointment to see us to discuss finding the cause for your condition and its subsequent treatment options. As the sooner the condition is diagnosed the sooner treatment solutions can start and a good nights sleep can be had.",
