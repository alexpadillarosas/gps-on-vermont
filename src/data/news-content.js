    title: "Is your or your partners snoring keeping you awake? They could have Sleep Apnoea?",
    contents: [
      "So what actually is snoring?",
      "Snoring occurs when airway passages are narrowed or obstructed causing inhaled air pressure to vibrate the soft palate.",
      "The airways or air passages run from your nose to your chest.",
      "In order to treat the snoring the cause needs to be identified.",
      "Possible causes could be:",
      "A blocked nose due to a cold or an allergy. This would be a temporary case of snoring, worsened if you need to open your mouth to breath as this would accentuate the vibration of the soft paplate.",
      "Extra weight and or soft tissue around your neck (can be caused by gaining weight or aging).", 
      "A very small jaw structure.",
      "The various causes mentioned above can all cause a drop in blood oxygen levels, due to the obstructed airways. The drop in blood oxygen levels results in needing to wake up in order to be able to breathe again. This results in a disrupted sleep of frequent waking through the night. The pattern repeats each time you fall back to sleep. Which also causes surges in blood pressure and in turn can put stress on the heart. All of this can result in not getting enough healthy deep sleep, disrupted hormone cycles, brain fog, poorer mental health and feeling fatigued constantly during the day etc.",
      "Luckily normal snoring is not considered to raise your risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke or high blood pressure.",
      "However, in sleep apnoea’s case breathing becomes disrupted. In some types of sleep apnoea the airway can become completely blocked off and result in a cessation of breathing altogether.",
      "Where as regular snoring generally occurs without the cessation of breathing.",
      "Sleep Apnoea should be taken care of as soon as possible due to the serious health risks associated with it.",
      "Sleep Apnoea is often broken down into three types:",
      "1)  Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA): involves a physical or anatomical blockage or narrowing of the airways.",
      "2)  Central sleep apnea: is a result of a communication issue between the brain and the airway muscles and doesn’t involve an obstructed airway.",
      "3)  Complex sleep apnea: in brief is a combination of obstructive sleep apnoea and central sleep apnea. It is fairly involved and more information about it can be found in the links listed below.",
      "Obstructive Sleep Apnoea is the most common of the three types and is further classified based on its severity.",
      "Its usually classified into mild, moderate or severe types. Severe OSA is considered the more harmful type as it repeatedly stops the breathing process during sleep. Where as in mild OSA sleep isn’t as disrupted. However, this can make it harder initially to identify as a cause of the sleeping disorders associated symptoms.",
      "Some general indicators of Sleep Apnoea can be:",
      "- Chronic snoring",
      "- Disrupted sleep often with frequent sudden waking",
      "- Constantly feeling tired on waking or fatigued throughout the day",
      "- Others noticing you pausing in breathing while asleep",
      "Some immediate remedies that could be trialed for mild OSA include:",
      "Changing your sleeping posture. For example switching to side lying instead of lying on your back.",
      "Reducing alcohol consumption. As it can impair the brains functionality including its instructions to the muscles that control breathing.",
      "If overweight losing some weight to ease any additional pressure around the neck and on the airways.",
      "If these changes don’t help you may need to see us to discuss other options such as:",
      "Using a mouth guard. These can range from store bought to actually seeing a specialist to get one especially fitted for your jaw",
      "CPAP (Continuous Positive Airways Pressure). It is a device that works like a reverse vacuum cleaner. Instead of sucking air up, it blows air into the airways to keep the airways propped open. However, it is a treatment that may not suit a lot of people as it involves wearing a mask every night when you sleep.",
      "Surgical procedures. These may be particularly considered if you’re a young person with the problem and it’s due to a structural issue like having a small jaw.",
      "As you can see snoring and sleep apnoea can be quite complex and have many causes. So the treatment options vary widely as well. There are more treatment options available than those mentioned above.",
      "You and your loved ones deserve a decent unbroken nights sleep!",
      "So please if either you or your loved one are a snorer, and you’re concerned about the impact it’s having on your health, make an appointment to see us to discuss finding the cause for your condition and its subsequent treatment options. As the sooner the condition is diagnosed the sooner treatment solutions can start and a good nights sleep can be had.",

    contents: [
      "Endometriosis also commonly referred as Endo is a complex chronic and usually painful condition that can disrupt women’s lives.",
      "It’s a condition where endometrium tissue that should leave a women’s body each month with her menstrual blood instead grows abnormally in areas outside of the uterus. Such as on the outer surface of the uterus, on connective tissues, on or around the fallopian tubes and the ovaries or even through the uterus’s muscular wall (a condition called adenomyosis).",
      "Though this tissue is in the wrong place, it’s cells still act like they are in the uterus and so can grow and bled every month just like they do during a women’s monthly cycle.",
      "This can cause irritation and pain in the surrounding tissue as the blood has no where to escape to. Resulting in inflammation and scaring. Unfortunately, this scar tissue can sometimes block the fallopian tubes making it hard to get pregnant.",
      "What causes it?",
      "There is no known cause for the endometriosis at this stage. Though it sometimes runs in families and interestingly may temporarily improve with pregnancy and resolve after menopause.",
      "It presents differently in everyone but some common symptoms include:",
      "* Persistent or continuous pelvic and abdominal pain",
      "* Menstrual cycle pain, disturbances or dysfunction",
      "* Migraines",
      "* Pain when defecating or urinating and/or bowel and urinary disturbances",
      "* Pain with intercourse.",
      "How is it diagnosed?",
      "Currently endometriosis can only be diagnosed via a surgical biopsy (laparoscopy).",
      "Due to it’s complex nature endometriosis often mimics symptoms of other conditions and so can be misdiagnosed if assessing the symptoms alone.",
      "Often a pelvic, abdominal or vaginal examination is performed or a trans abdominal ultrasound scan may be required in order to rule out other causes and to be used as a marker. However, these examinations are not effective tools for diagnosing endometriosis.",
      "Hopefully in the not too distant future diagnostic tools won’t be limited to a surgical biopsy and a non-surgerical intervention such as a simple blood test or a scan will be able to diagnose it.",
      "How is it effectively treated and managed?",
      "Endometriosis treatment and management is currently focussed on improving the woman’s quality of life by relieving symptoms and discomfort such as pain.",
      "When choosing the treatment method a woman’s individual symptoms, health, life goals and situation will be considered. As well as any contraindications, the dose strength required and any possible side effects of the medication such as weight gain or mood disturbances. Also if she is wanting to have children in the near future then we would need to discuss and plan which pill or treatment method would have the least impact on that goal and what would work best for her.",
      "That being said there are three general approaches to treatment that are used these are:",
      "1. Pain management with the use of NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).",
      "2. Hormonal management with either a combined oral contraceptive pill or an oral progestin pill.",
      "3. Removal of abnormal endometrial tissue via Laproscopic surgery.",
      "What can you do to help diagnosis or manage it?",
      "1. Track your pain in a pain diary or on a menstrual app. This is helpful in identifying any patterns. For example does the pain line up with your menstrual cycle?",
      "2. Once diagnosed if there are any problems with your treatment or if your life plans change make an appointment with us as soon as possible so we can amend your treatment accordingly. As mentioned above there are a range of treatments available. The same treatment doesn’t necessarily work the same way for everyone. It depends on your individual situation, stage of endometriosis, age and pregnancy plans as to what will work best for you.",
      "If you have any queries about the information mentioned above, are experiencing symptoms, have concerns about your fertility or any other health concerns make an appointment to see us. It could be endometriosis or something else behind your symptoms. The sooner we can help you get a diagnosis, the sooner we can help with treatment and management and you can return to having a good quality of life.",

      "These names are often interchangeable and refer to the body’s anatomical structures.", 
      "Where the tumour is located anatomically is important when considering the symptoms, deciding on treatments and for evaluating possible disease progression and prognosis.",
      "The colon (large intestine or large bowel) and rectum comprise part of the gastrointestinal tract (digestive tract).", 
      "This tract runs from your mouth to your anus and includes organs such as your stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum and anus",
      "The bowel includes the colon, which runs from the end of the small intestine to the rectum, and the rectum  which then travels on to the anus.",
      "Most bowel cancers are either found in the rectum or sigmoid colon.",
      "However they can also be found in other parts of the colon as well including the recto-sigmoid junction, splenic flexure, hepatic flexure and or caecum.",
      "Bowel cancer occurs when something triggers colon or rectum cells to mutate. This abnormal cell growth continues to grow until it forms a small lump. This lump is commonly referred as a lesion or polyp. The polyp can then continue to grow over the next five to fifteen years until large enough to grow into deeper structures and possibly metastasis (spread to other regions of the body).",
      "During a colonoscopy the surgeon will try and remove any small to medium polyps found during the investigation. With the intention of stoping the discovered polyps from growing into cancerous growths or tumours. Unfortunately, colonoscopies can’t prevent new growths from forming later on, they can only remove current ones.",
      "The good news is that the vast majority of polyps found during a screening do not turn out to be cancerous.",
      "Most bowel cancers are comprised of Adenocarcinomas (glandular epithelial cells). These cells usually produce mucous for the digestive tract.",
      "Other less common cells types which can become bowel cancer are: Squamous Cell (squamous cells that line the Bowel), Sarcomas (connective tissue cells) most in the Bowel and rectum are lyomyosarcomas (cancers of smooth muscle cells), Carcinoid or Neuroendocrine Tumour (grow in hormone producing tissues usually in the digestive system) and Lymphomas (tumours in the lyphatic system).",
      "Each type of bowel cancer has a different cause, symptoms and treatments. So if diagnosed it is useful to understand which cell type yours is comprised of.",

      "▫︎▫︎⦿ Something feels wrong. Might have vague symptoms of fatigue or feeling just not right",
      "▫︎▫︎⦿ Bleeding (on toilet paper or in the stool). It may start out small and intermittently and increase in frequency and volume as time passes. Any bleeding should be investigated. It may or may not be a sign of cancer but you won’t know until you know the cause.",
      "▫︎▫︎⦿ Changes in bowel habits such as an increased frequency or change in consistency eg.diarrhoea or constipation.",

It’s a good idea to start getting checked even if you’re asymptomatic. As you’re at a higher risk. It’s often a good idea to get tested at least 10 years earlier than the age they were when they were diagnosed with it. There could be life style factors, certain high-risk genetic disorders such as a family cancer gene that puts you more at risk.",

They can be internal or external risks. Some bowel cancers such as neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) of the colon and rectum have no known risk factors other than possibly genetics. Cells frequently mutate during cell replication. Usually our immune system identifies these errors and resolves them. However, if for some reason these mutations get missed then growths occur. These growths are often harmless. But at other times as in bowel cancers they’re not. Our understanding of the human body is evolving all the time. Hopefully in the near future we will have more knowledge on the causes of different cancers.

        "▫︎⦿ Keep a routine. Routines help to give you a sense of control and order. Despite the chaos around you. If you have a routine is it still working for you or do you need to tweak it? If you don’t have one what do you need to include in one to then implement it? Routines don’t have to be complicated. They can be as simple as making your bed in the morning.",
        "▫︎⦿ Reduce your intake of processed foods. Unfortunately food additives, preservatives and colourings can impact your body chemistry, which in turn could affect your mood and mental health. ",
        "▫︎⦿ Get more fresh air whenever possible. Either by going outside or by opening windows. If cold indoors with the window open can another layer of clothes help? As fresh air helps remove stagnation.",

        "▫︎⦿ Include mindfulness or relaxation practices into your life. Such as meditation, breathing techniques, yoga, tai chi etc.",
        "▫︎⦿ Improve your sleep hygiene. Do you need to eliminate screens? Can you put them away at least an hour before bed time? How is your room temperature, light exposure and noise levels? Can you get a good nights sleep with them? ",

        "-",
        "Some ideas you could try that may help boost your emotional health could be:",
        "▫︎⦿ Reaching out to friends and loved ones. Have a face to face chat. Whether via phone or in person. Though texting and emails are great. A face to face chat where you can see the other persons expressions is much more emotionally rewarding.",
        "▫︎⦿ Play some games. Take at least a weekly break to play. Whether online or in person. Consider joining a group or a club. There are plenty of games nowadays to choose from. Even if you work odd hours and live alone there are ways to connect with others especially online. ",
        "▫︎⦿ Journal or write in a gratitude diary. There are a lot of sites online that give pointers on how to do this. Some people find journaling helpful as a record for this period of time, getting strong thoughts and feelings out of the mind and body. Some find it a great tool for reflection. Others find a gratitude diary a useful tool to help refocus your attention to what has gone well in your day etc. ",
        "▫︎⦿ Increase your daily laughing quota. When was the last time you laughed? Are you laughing at least once a day? Laughter has numerous health benefits. As this webpage from the US Department of Veteran Affairs shows: https://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTHLIBRARY/tools/healing-benefits-humor-laughter.asp. As a society we need to increase it. Genuine laughter more often. There are some great comedy tv series online. Or perhaps you need to share some memes or social media clips with some friends. Or ring someone up for a chat and a joke. There are also laughing yoga clubs online and in the community that you may want to try. Learn more about it here: https://laughteryoga-australia.org/",
        "▫︎⦿ Doing an act of kindness for another. Can you do some volunteer work? Check in on a neighbour? It doesn’t have to be in person. It can be on the phone or via text. Or even dropping a note into their letter box when you leave the house for your daily walk. Connecting with others can be very rewarding and enhance your sense of belonging in your community.",
        "▫︎⦿ Setting boundaries and taking a time out for yourself. Do you need a break away from others anxiety and demands? Set some time aside for you. Say “No” when you need to. You cannot help others when you have no reserves left for yourself.",
        "▫︎⦿ Giving yourself permission to feel your emotions. Acknowledge them as they arise. Especially strong or uncomfortable emotions. You may find yelling these into a pillow, put them into music or writing them down in a journal could help. How ever you want to acknowledge them is unique to you. If not pleasant such as stress emotions are there things you can do to reduce them? If they temporarily feel overwhelming perhaps you need to distract yourself for a bit. Can you take a bath, burn some oils, play some music, read a book or listen to a audio book or podcast? If you’re looking for some good books or podcasts etc. our local library’s have a fabulous selection of online resources that you shouldn’t be bored.
